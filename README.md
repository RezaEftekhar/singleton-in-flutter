# Singleton Design Pattern Example in Flutter

This project is a simple demonstration of implementing the Singleton design pattern in a Flutter application. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
https://github.com/RezaEftekhar/singleton-in-flutter.git


2. Open the project in your preferred Flutter development environment.

3. Run the application on an emulator or physical device.

## Implementation Details

### Singleton Class

The `MySingletonExample` class is implemented as a Singleton to ensure that only one instance of the class is created throughout the application's lifecycle. It provides two methods, `GetFirstData` and `GetSecondtData`, which return specific data.

### User Interface

The app consists of a single screen, `HomePage`, that displays two buttons. Each button triggers a method from the Singleton class to update the displayed message. The message is displayed in the center of the screen.

## Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In this project, the Singleton pattern is implemented to guarantee that only one instance of `MySingletonExample` is created and shared across the application.

### Usage in the Project

The Singleton pattern is utilized in the `main.dart` file to create an instance of `MySingletonExample` and use its methods to retrieve data. The instance is created using the `MySingletonExample()` constructor, which returns the same instance for subsequent calls.

## Usage

Clone the repository and use the code as a reference to understand the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in a Flutter application.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project based on your requirements.
